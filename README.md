# Dual-Convolutional-Malware-Network-DCMN
In our work, we presented a novel approach for malware classification using a dual deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Our method leverages both pre-trained ResNet-50 and a custom convolutional neural network to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance.

# Dual-Convolutional-Malware-Network-DCMN
In our work, we presented a novel approach for malware classification using a dual deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Our method The model leverages the complementary strengths of a custom structure extraction branch and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for malware image classification. By combining features extracted from both branches, the model achieved a superior performance compared to a single branch approach.
